## Custom RPC Methods

Custom RPC methods can be called with the [`w3.Client`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lmittmann/w3#Client) by creating a
[`w3types.Caller`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lmittmann/w3/w3types#Caller) implementation.


## Third-Party Packages

Packages that provide additional RPC method bindings.
